"reduced visa fees",NA,"602.2",NA

"Because this is a long-term problem that will affect so many people, any solution has to be able to survive long-term.",NA,"404",NA
"We must build the same level of consensus on social care as we have already built on the NHS.",NA,"404",NA
"So we will build a cross-party consensus to bring forward an answer that solves the problem, commands the widest possible support, and stands the test of time.",NA,"404",NA
"That consensus will consider a range of options but one condition we do make is that nobody needing care should be forced to sell their home to pay for it.",NA,"403",NA

"We need a long-term solution for social care – that’s why we are committing to an ambitious three-point plan: £1 billion extra of funding every year for more social care staff",NA,"504",NA
"and better infrastructure, technology and facilities.",NA,"411",NA
"We will commit to urgently seek a cross-party consensus in order to bring forward the necessary proposal and legislation for long-term reform.",NA,"404",NA

"As Conservatives, we believe absolutely in equality of opportunity – the idea that every child, in every part of the country, should have a fair chance.",NA,"503",NA
"It is not only the most important thing we can do to unleash the UK’s potential, but is at the heart of creating a fair and just society.",NA,"503",NA

"while learning in an environment where they will be happy and fulfilled.",NA,"506",NA
"In his first months in office, Boris Johnson announced an extra £14 billion in funding for schools.",NA,"506",NA

"and at least £4,000 for each primary school pupil.",NA,"506",NA
"This also includes £780 million in new funding to support children with Special Educational Needs next year alone.",NA,"506",NA
"One of the Conservative Party’s proudest achievements is that we have raised standards in our schools and improved behaviour.",NA,"305.1",NA

"In the last nine years, the percentage of children passing their primary reading check has gone up from 58 per cent to 82 per cent.",NA,"506",NA
"We have strengthened teachers’ powers to deal with bullying and disruption.",NA,"506",NA
"We have given schools the ability to decide how money is best spent – because we trust parents and headteachers to know what is best for the children in their care.",NA,"201.1",NA
"For our children to get the training and opportunities they deserve, they need to have the best teachers.",NA,"506",NA
"We want tonattract the best talent into teaching and recognise the great work they do, so we’re raising teachers’ starting salaries to £30,000 – among the most competitive in the graduate labour market.",NA,"412",NA
"We also want to build on our record of raising standards, improving behaviour",NA,"603",NA
"and promoting knowledge and creativity.",NA,"506",NA
"We will back heads and teachers on discipline.",NA,"603",NA
"We will expand our programme to help schools with the worst behaviour learn from the best –",NA,"506",NA
"and back heads to use exclusions.",NA,"201.1",NA
"Unlike Labour, we believe that Ofsted inspection serves a valuable purpose not just in improving standards but in improving behaviour.",NA,"603",NA
"We will continue to help teachers tackle bullying, including homophobic bullying.",NA,"503",NA
"No child should be bullied on account of who their parents are or where they come from.",NA,"503",NA
"We will create more great schools.",NA,"506",NA

"Over the last nine years we have made real improvements in maths, English and science, and given more children access to a rich academic curriculum.",NA,"506",NA
"We retain our commitment to the core subjects and also want young people to learn creative skills and widen their horizons, so we will offer an ‘arts premium’ to secondary schools to fund enriching activities for all pupils.",NA,"502",NA

"Vulnerable children",NA,"H",NA
"Children who end up in care are more likely to struggle as adults, denied the love and stability most of us take for granted.",NA,"603",NA

"That is an extraordinary figure.",NA,"305.1",NA
"And it has only been possible because of the strong economy we have helped to create;",NA,"402",NA
"our support for business;",NA,"402",NA
"and our welfare reforms, which have encouraged more people into work.",NA,"505",NA

"Whoever you are, we want to make it easier for you to get a good and rewarding job",NA,"701",NA

"To help young people get a foot on the employment ladder, we abolished employers’ National Insurance Contributions for under-21s",NA,"701",NA

"Creating millions more jobs is one of the Conservatives’ proudest achievements.",NA,"701",NA
"A Labour Government that makes it harder for businesses to grow and to hire –",NA,"402",NA
"that allows people to sink into dependency rather than encouraging them to work and earn – could undo all of this progress.",NA,"505",NA
"A majority Conservative Government will deliver a major package of measures designed to ensure that it always pays to work,",NA,"505",NA
"while doing everything we can to protect and support those who cannot",NA,"504",NA
"– and to address the cost of living pressures that we all face.",NA,"503",NA

"We will raise the National Insurance threshold to £9,500 next year – representing a tax cut for 31 million workers.",NA,"401",NA
"Our ultimate ambition is to ensure that the first £12,500 you earn is completely free of tax – which would put almost £500 per year in people’s pockets.",NA,"401",NA
"Raising a family should be the most fulfilling experience of your life.",NA,"603",NA

"We have led the international fight against aggressive tax avoidance and offshore tax havens, rewriting global rules to ensure tax is paid where profit is made.",NA,"403",NA
"This has included committing 100 jurisdictions to ending bank secrecy.",NA,"403",NA
"But we can go further still.",NA,"403",NA
"The gap between the amount of tax that should be paid and is actually collected stands at £35 billion – still too high.",NA,"403",NA
"Hard-working families and businesses who do pay their fair share should know that we will not permit evasion to go unchecked.",NA,"403",NA

"Whatever age you are, nothing is more Conservative than working hard to improve your lot",NA,"505",NA

"Our reforms and investment in education and skills mean more children are leaving school better equipped for working life",NA,"411",NA

"As the centrepiece of our plan, we will create a new National Skills Fund worth £3 billion over the next Parliament.",NA,"411",NA

"A proportion will be reserved for further strategic investment in skills, and we will consult widely on the overall design.",NA,"411",NA
"The National Skills Fund will help to transform the lives of people who have not got onto the work ladder and lack qualifications,",NA,"411",NA

"It will not only make this country more prosperous, but fairer.",NA,"601.1",NA
"Just as universities have been transformed by significant long-term investment over the last few decades, we need to make sure local colleges are equally excellent places for people to learn.",NA,"506",NA
