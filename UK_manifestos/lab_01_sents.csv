"Fulfilling Britain’s great potential",NA,NA,NA
"This general election is in many ways even more important than the last.",NA,NA,NA
"Since May 1997 we have laid the foundations of a Britain whose economy is stronger, where investment is now pouring into public services, where social division is being slowly healed and where influence abroad is being regained.",NA,NA,NA
"But these are only the foundations of larger change.",NA,NA,NA
"Now is the chance to build the future properly, to make the second term the basis for a radical programme of British renewal: to keep a firm grip on inflation, with low interest rates and the public finances sound, and then build the dynamic and productive economy of the future;",NA,NA,NA
"to keep investment coming into public services and then making the reforms so we use the money well;",NA,NA,NA
"to refashion the welfare state on the basis of rights and responsibilities, with people helped to help themselves, not just given handouts;",NA,NA,NA
"to ensure all families are safe in their communities by tackling crime and its causes;",NA,NA,NA
"and to give Britain back its leadership role in the world.",NA,NA,NA
"We need the second term to do all this.",NA,NA,NA
"That is the choice: to make progress or to dismantle the foundations laid.",NA,NA,NA
"And with the state of today’s Conservatives, the choice is stark.",NA,NA,NA
"This choice will decide whether more people will be able to realise their aspirations for themselves and their children – to be able to rely on a stable economy where hard work is rewarded by rising living standards, to receive world-class education and healthcare, to enjoy a dignified old age, to feel safe and secure in a strong community, and to be proud to be British.",NA,NA,NA
"Or whether we will be held back by the traditional British malaise of restricting life’s great opportunities and blessings to a minority.",NA,NA,NA
"There is much still to be done, but we have come a long way in four years.",NA,NA,NA
"Britain stands more prosperous, more equal, more respected.",NA,NA,NA
"Our country is on a new course.",NA,NA,NA
"My passion is to continue the modernisation of Britain in favour of hard-working families, so that all our children, wherever they live, whatever their background, have an equal chance to benefit from the opportunities our country has to offer and to share in its wealth.",NA,NA,NA
"The challenge for Britain.",NA,NA,NA
"I am honoured to be Prime Minister.",NA,NA,NA
"And I have a confident belief in our country.",NA,NA,NA
"We are not boastful.",NA,NA,NA
"But we have real strengths.",NA,NA,NA
"Great people.",NA,NA,NA
"Strong values.",NA,NA,NA
"A proud history.",NA,NA,NA
"The British people achieved magnificent things in the 20th century.",NA,NA,NA
"But for too long, our strengths have been undermined by weaknesses of elitism and snobbery, vested interests and social division, complacency bred by harking back to the past.",NA,NA,NA
"We achieved spurts of economic growth, but inflation would then get out of control.",NA,NA,NA
"Our welfare state was founded to offer security, but its progress was stalled.",NA,NA,NA
"We reached out to Europe, then drew back to become semi-detached.",NA,NA,NA
"It is as if a glass ceiling has stopped us fulfilling our potential.",NA,NA,NA
"In the 21st century, we have the opportunity to break through that glass ceiling, because our historic strengths match the demands of the modern world.",NA,NA,NA
"We can use our openness and entrepreneurial flair to become a global centre in the knowledge economy.",NA,NA,NA
"We can use our sense of fair play and mutual responsibility to be a strong, dynamic, multiracial society held together by strong values.",NA,NA,NA
"We can use our historic and geographical position to link Europe and America, and help the developing world.",NA,NA,NA
"The key to tapping our strengths, to breaking through this glass ceiling, is contained in a simple but hard-to-achieve idea, set out at the heart of our party’s constitution: the determination to put power, wealth and opportunity in the hands of the many, not the few.",NA,NA,NA
"I know as well as anyone that we have just begun; millions of hard-working families want, need and deserve more.",NA,NA,NA
"That means more change in a second term, not less – to extend opportunity for all.",NA,NA,NA
"We reject the quiet life.",NA,NA,NA
"We must secure a mandate for change.",NA,NA,NA
"Ten goals for 2010:",NA,NA,NA
"• Long-term economic stability.",NA,NA,NA
"• Rising living standards for all.",NA,NA,NA
"•Expanded higher education as we raise standards in secondary schools.",NA,NA,NA
"• A healthier nation with fast treatment, free at the point of use.",NA,NA,NA
"•Full employment in every region.",NA,NA,NA
"• Opportunity for all children, security for all pensioners.",NA,NA,NA
"• A modern criminal justice system.",NA,NA,NA
"• Strong and accountable local government.",NA,NA,NA
"• British ideas leading a reformed and enlarged Europe.",NA,NA,NA
"• Global poverty and climate change tackled.",NA,NA,NA
"Shifting the odds for hard-working families.",NA,NA,NA
"In 1997 we promised a start, not a revolution.",NA,NA,NA
"We made five specific five-year pledges.",NA,NA,NA
"Three have been completed early; all will be completed within five years, as we promised.",NA,NA,NA
"Each pledge is matched by further achievement: the lowest inflation and unemployment for a generation; one million new jobs; over 17,000 extra nurses, the best primary school test results ever and, as the British Crime Survey shows, crime is down by ten per cent.",NA,NA,NA
"We also offered a ten-point contract to the British people.",NA,NA,NA
"The results are at the back of this manifesto.",NA,NA,NA
"Not everything has gone right – it never does.",NA,NA,NA
"But we are getting there, easing burdens and extending opportunities, by choice not chance.",NA,NA,NA
"Economic instability wrecks the lives of hard-working families.",NA,NA,NA
"So we chose to put the public finances right.",NA,NA,NA
"It meant tough decisions that were opposed by the Conservatives.",NA,NA,NA
"But today the economy is stable and growing, and interest rates are nearly half the level they averaged under the Conservatives.",NA,NA,NA
"Unemployment steals dignity.",NA,NA,NA
"So we chose to introduce a windfall tax on the excess profits of the privatised utilities and to use the money to help unemployed people back to work.",NA,NA,NA
"That was opposed by the Conservatives, who are now pledged to abolish the New Deal.",NA,NA,NA
"But today, youth unemployment is at its lowest level since 1975 and longterm unemployment at its lowest level since 1978.",NA,NA,NA
"Poor education is a cruel injustice.",NA,NA,NA
"So we chose to introduce a new system for teaching the basics in primary schools.",NA,NA,NA
"We met opposition, and the Conservatives want to roll back our programmes.",NA,NA,NA
"But today, primary schools are achieving their best results ever.",NA,NA,NA
"A run-down health service causes insecurity.",NA,NA,NA
"So we chose to reform the NHS, and inject new money.",NA,NA,NA
"Waiting lists and times are now down and falling, and the number of nurses and doctors is now rising.",NA,NA,NA
"Poverty denies basic rights.",NA,NA,NA
"So we chose to reform the welfare state to channel extra money to the poorest pensioners and poorest children.",NA,NA,NA
"Today, single pensioners can look forward to a minimum income of £100 a week and pensioner couples £154, and over one million children have been taken out of poverty.",NA,NA,NA
"The centralisation of power only helps the powerful.",NA,NA,NA
"So we chose to break the suffocating centralisation of British government.",NA,NA,NA
"The UK has been strengthened.",NA,NA,NA
"Today, it is the Conservatives who threaten the stability of the UK with their proposals for two classes of MP.",NA,NA,NA
"Our Scottish and Welsh manifestos, alongside this one, set out our vision for continued partnership.",NA,NA,NA
"Isolation from Europe does not help anyone.",NA,NA,NA
"So we chose to engage constructively in Europe, not to shout abuse from the sidelines.",NA,NA,NA
"Today, Europe is moving in a direction that is good for Britain and good for Europe.",NA,NA,NA
"In policy for aid, development and international debt relief, we have led the way.",NA,NA,NA
"Of course, there are still big problems, but we are better off, better educated, better governed, better respected abroad.",NA,NA,NA
"There has been another change too – a change of priorities and values.",NA,NA,NA
"We learnt in the 1980s that looking after number one was not enough; that without opportunity, responsibility was weak; that an unfair society was a less prosperous one.",NA,NA,NA
"The philosophy was wrong – it hurt millions of families and left our country with lasting problems.",NA,NA,NA
"We have shown we are a reformed party, competent to govern.",NA,NA,NA
"Now we offer more.",NA,NA,NA
"More change, and more rewards for Britain’s hard-working families: more prosperity, more opportunities, more security.",NA,NA,NA
"Ambitions for Britain.",NA,NA,NA
"Stretching the family budget, finding time for children as well as work, holding on to mutual respect, staying healthy when there can be danger even in the air we breathe.",NA,NA,NA
"These are daily worries that people face.",NA,NA,NA
"They are my concerns too.",NA,NA,NA
"But, while there is always a market for people who say we are doomed, that all new ideas are bad ideas even as things improve, that we might as well curl up with our prejudices and shut the door on the world, I am an optimist.",NA,NA,NA
"New Labour is ambitious for Britain’s future and is ready to lead.",NA,NA,NA
"First, we will sustain economic stability and build deeper prosperity that reaches every region of the country.",NA,NA,NA
"Skills, infrastructure, the technological revolution – all are vital to raise British living standards faster.",NA,NA,NA
"We will put as much energy into helping the seven million adults without basic skills as we did when tackling long-term unemployment through the New Deal.",NA,NA,NA
"Second, we seek to achieve a renaissance of status and quality for public services and their staff.",NA,NA,NA
"We will build on our success in primary schools to overhaul secondary schools;",NA,NA,NA
"we will invest new resources and empower doctors and nurses to transform health services;",NA,NA,NA
"and we will seek to extend the very best in culture and sport to all.",NA,NA,NA
"Third, we seek to modernise the welfare state.",NA,NA,NA
"The benefits system will be restructured around work; support for children and families through the tax and benefits system will be transformed; cash and services for pensioners will be radically improved.",NA,NA,NA
"Fourth, we will strengthen our communities.",NA,NA,NA
"We will reform the criminal justice system at every level so that criminals are caught, punished and rehabilitated.",NA,NA,NA
"And because we know that without tackling the causes of crime we will never tackle crime, we will empower local communities by combining resources with responsibility.",NA,NA,NA
"Fifth, we will turn our inner confidence to strength abroad, in Europe and beyond, to tackle global problems",NA,NA,NA
"– above all, environmental degradation and the shame of global poverty.",NA,NA,NA
"We will engage fully in Europe, help enlarge the European Union and make it more effective, and insist that the British people have the final say on any proposal to join the Euro.",NA,NA,NA
"These ambitions are summarised in ten goals for 2010.",NA,NA,NA
"They will never be achieved by government alone.",NA,NA,NA
"We know it is people who ultimately change the country.",NA,NA,NA
"Our partnership with the voluntary sector has steadily strengthened since 1997, as we learn from its diversity.",NA,NA,NA
"We work with the private sector, drawing on its vitality.",NA,NA,NA
"Countries only prosper on the basis of partnership – between government, employers and their employees, and the voluntary sector.",NA,NA,NA
"What Britain needs is an active, enabling state, not a nanny state, doing things with people not to them.",NA,NA,NA
"So, while the Conservatives will spend most of this election telling you what their government cannot do, this manifesto sets out what our government can do.",NA,NA,NA
"We know the power and value of markets, but we also know their limits.",NA,NA,NA
"Now is the time to renew our civic and social institutions to deliver improvements in education, health, safety, transport and the environment.",NA,NA,NA
"Fighting for values, not just for election victory.",NA,NA,NA
"The Conservatives always look back.",NA,NA,NA
"In economic policy they promise to repeat the mistakes of the 1980s – unaffordable tax cuts and spending cuts, followed by ballooning deficits, rising interest rates and the old cycle of boom and bust.",NA,NA,NA
"In social policy their renewed commitment to cuts and privatisation and to withdrawing the support helping to heal social division, is just a throwback to the 1980s.",NA,NA,NA
"In foreign policy they risk not just isolation but exit from the EU.",NA,NA,NA
"Jobs, trade, investment depend on our membership of the European Union.",NA,NA,NA
"The Conservative policy of opposing the enlargement of Europe in the Nice Treaty and their pledge to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s EU membership is dangerous and ill thought-out.",NA,NA,NA
"Standing up for Britain means fighting for Britain’s interests in Europe, not leaving Europe – which threatens our national interest.",NA,NA,NA
"So the choice Britain faces today is starker than in 1997.",NA,NA,NA
"The Conservatives have swung further to the right.",NA,NA,NA
"And, in government, Labour’s agenda has become increasingly bold and ambitious.",NA,NA,NA
"For many years, the Conservatives claimed to offer economic strength while Labour dominated social issues.",NA,NA,NA
"Many people found their head telling them to vote Tory, and their heart telling them to vote Labour.",NA,NA,NA
"Today, head and heart are coming together.",NA,NA,NA
"New Labour is proving that it is only by using the talents of all that we get a healthy economy, and that it is only by giving a stake to all that we are a healthy society.",NA,NA,NA
"We have made our choice: stability not boom and bust; investment not cuts; engagement not isolationism; the many, not the few.",NA,NA,NA
"A lot done and a lot more to do with new Labour – or a lot for you to lose under the Conservatives.",NA,NA,NA
"I deeply believe that, for Britain, the best is still to come.",NA,NA,NA
"So I ask you to continue on this journey with us.",NA,NA,NA
"Together we can achieve so much more.",NA,NA,NA
"Prime Minister and Leader of the Labour Party",NA,NA,NA

"Our ten-year goal of reducing crime depends on reform of the criminal justice system at every level, from police to courts to prison – to put crime reduction centre stage.",NA,"605",NA
"And, because crime is changing, crime fighting has to change too – to tackle repeat offending, drug-related crime and organised crime.",NA,"605",NA
