"Britain’s failure to get all its regional and local economies working can be seen in the deterioration of the country’s current account,",NA,"414",NA

"Our industrial strategy will be built on objective, measurable missions designed to address the great challenges of our times.",NA,"411",NA
"In meeting these challenges, we will move beyond the narrow approaches of the past, and mobilise the talents and resources of our whole country to deliver an economy fit for the future.",NA,"411",NA

"We will also encourage private investment by removing new plant and machinery from business rate calculations.",NA,"402",NA

"Following the successful example of Germany and the Nordic countries, we will establish a National Investment Bank that will bring in private capital finance to deliver £250 billion of lending power.",NA,"413",NA
"This new public institution will support a network of regional development banks that, unlike giant City of London firms, will be dedicated to supporting inclusive growth in their communities.",NA,"416.2",NA
"The banks will deliver the finance that our small businesses, co-operatives and innovative projects need across the whole country.",NA,"403",NA

"We will commit to creating a more diverse banking system, backed up by legislation.",NA,"403",NA
"A NEW DEAL FOR BUSINESS",NA,"H",NA
"The majority of businesses play by the rules: they pay their taxes and their workers reasonably and on time, and they operate with respect for the environment and local communities.",NA,"416.2",NA
"That is why it is vital that government ensures that businesses doing the right thing are rewarded rather than undercut or outbid by those unscrupulous few that cut corners, whether on taxes, workers’ conditions, environmental standards, or consumer safety and protection.",NA,"416.2",NA
"But our business culture doesn’t always work like this.",NA,"416.2",NA
"Scandals such as the failure of BHS show how the longterm growth of a company can be sacrificed for the sake of a quick buck.",NA,"416.2",NA
"When shareholders are looking for quick short-term returns, they encourage companies to cut corners.",NA,"416.2",NA
"That means they look to cut wages, instead of investing for the long term, or they spend longer inventing new tax avoidance schemes than they do inventing new products.",NA,"416.2",NA
"By reforming the rules our companies operate under, we can make sure they stay focused on delivering shared wealth.",NA,"503",NA
"Labour will amend company law so that directors owe a duty directly not only shareholders, but to employees, customers, the environment and the wider public, and we will consult on bringing forward appropriate legislation within this Parliament.",NA,"416.2",NA

"Our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of our economy, providing 60 per cent of private-sector jobs.",NA,"402",NA
"Technological changes, like the spread of digital manufacturing and rapid communication, mean smaller, faster businesses will be the future of our economy.",NA,"402",NA

"Labour is the party of small businesses.",NA,"402",NA
"We understand the challenges our smaller businesses face.",NA,"402",NA

"Introduce a package of reforms to business rates – including switching from RPI to CPI indexation,",NA,"402",NA

"Labour will aim to double the size of the co-operative sector in the UK, putting it on a par with those in leading economies like Germany or the US.",NA,"404",NA
"WIDENING OWNERSHIP OF OUR ECONOMY",NA,"H",NA
"Britain is a long-established democracy.",NA,"202.1",NA
"But the distribution of ownership of the country’s economy means that decisions about our economy are often made by a narrow elite.",NA,"202.1",NA
"More democratic ownership structures would help our economy deliver for the many and lead to a fairer distribution of wealth.",NA,"503",NA
"In government, Labour would give more people a stake – and a say -  in our economy by doubling the size of the co-operative sector and introducing a “right to own,” making employees the buyer of first refusal when the company they work for is up for sale.",NA,"202.1",NA
"We will act to ‘insource’ our public and local council services as preferred providers.",NA,"413",NA
"Many basic goods and services have been taken out of democratic control through privatisation.",NA,"413",NA
"This has often led to higher prices and poorer quality, as prices are raised to pay out dividends.",NA,"413",NA
"For example, water bills have increased 40 per cent since privatisation, and our private energy providers overcharged customers by £2 billion in 2015.",NA,"413",NA
"In private hands, Royal Mail has increased stamp and parcel charges, and failed to meet its customer service obligations, while its owners trade shares at significant profit.",NA,"413",NA
"The Conservative Government’s privatisation of Royal Mail was a historic mistake, selling off another national asset on the cheap.",NA,"413",NA
"Across the world, countries are taking public utilities back into public ownership.",NA,"413",NA

"Replace our dysfunctional water system with a network of regional publicly-owned water companies.",NA,"413",NA
"Reverse the privatisation of Royal Mail at the earliest opportunity.",NA,"413",NA
"Public ownership will benefit consumers, ensuring that their interests are put first and that there is democratic accountability for the service.",NA,"413",NA
"SUSTAINABLE ENERGY",NA,"H",NA
"Labour’s energy policy is built on three simple principles: ·To ensure security of energy supply and ‘keep the lights on’.",NA,"411",NA
"To ensure energy costs are affordable for consumers and businesses.",NA,"412",NA
"To ensure we meet our climate change targets and transition to a low-carbon economy.",NA,"501",NA
"The UK energy system is outdated, expensive and polluting.",NA,"411",NA
"Privatisation has failed to deliver an energy system that delivers for people, businesses or our environment.",NA,"413",NA
"One in ten households are in fuel poverty, yet the Competition Markets Authority found customers are overcharged an enormous £2 billion every year.",NA,"412",NA
"Labour understands that many people don’t have time to shop around, they just want reliable and affordable energy.",NA,"412",NA
"So the next Labour Government will: ·Introduce an immediate emergency price cap to ensure that the average dual-fuel household energy bill remains below £1,000 per year, while we transition to a fairer system for bill payers.",NA,"412",NA
"Take energy back into public ownership to deliver renewable energy, affordability for consumers, and democratic control.",NA,"413",NA

"Labour will insulate four million homes as an infrastructure priority to help those who suffer in cold homes each winter.",NA,"411",NA

"save on bills,",NA,"504",NA
"and reduce fuel poverty and winter deaths.",NA,"504",NA
"Homeowners will be offered interestfree loans to improve their property.",NA,"411",NA
"For renters, Labour will improve on existing Landlord Energy Efficiency regulations and re-establish the Landlord Energy Saving Allowance to encourage the uptake of efficiency measures.",NA,"411",NA
"Labour will ban fracking because it would lock us into an energy infrastructure based on fossil fuels, long after the point in 2030 when the Committee on Climate Change says gas in the UK must sharply decline.",NA,"501",NA
"Emerging technologies such as carbon capture and storage will help to smooth the transition to cleaner fuels",NA,"501",NA
"and to protect existing Jobs as part of the future energy mix.",NA,"701",NA
"To safeguard the offshore oil and gas industry, we will provide a strategy focused on protecting vital North Sea assets, and thejobs and skills that depend on them.",NA,"411",NA

"A Labour government will put us back on track to meet the targets in the Climate Change Act and the Paris Agreement.",NA,"501",NA
"The low-carbon economy is one of the UK’s fastest-growing sectors, creating jobs and providing investment across each region.",NA,"411",NA
"It employed an estimated 447,000 employees in the UK in 2015 and saw over £77 billion in turnover.",NA,"411",NA
"With backing from a Labour government, these sectors can secure crucial shares of global export markets.",NA,"411",NA
"Currently, the UK buys and sells energy tariff free from Europe, an arrangement which saves families and businesses money, and helps balance the power grid.",NA,"407",NA
"As part of the Brexit negotiations, Labour will prioritise maintaining access to the internal energy market.",NA,"407",NA
"Labour will also retain access to Euratom, to allow continued trade of fissile material, with access and collaboration over research vital to our nuclear industry.",NA,"411",NA

"And they should not be used as bargaining chips.",NA,"108",NA
"It is shameful that the Prime Minister rejected repeated attempts by Labour to resolve this issue before Article 50 was triggered.",NA,"305.2",NA
"As a result three million EU nationals have suffered unnecessary uncertainty, as have the 1.2 million UK citizens living in the EU.",NA,"108",NA

"deregulate the economy,",NA,"403",NA

"sideline Parliament and democratic accountability,",NA,"202.1",NA
"and cut Britain off from our closest allies and most important trading partners.",NA,"108",NA
